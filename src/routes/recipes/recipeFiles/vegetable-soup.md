Use a Dutch Oven to make a bunch of soup! You can mix it up, I normally use what I have on hand. I am recalling this recipe from memory - it is very flexible.

## Ingredients

- 2 TBSP olive oil
- 2-4 cloves of garlic
- 1 chopped onion
- 1/2 chopped bell pepper
- cubed potatoes
- sliced carrots
- 2 stalks celery sliced
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 1 can black beans or kidney beans drained
- **Add any or all of the following vegetables:**
  - chopped fresh cabbage
  - frozen or fresh corn
  - frozen peas
  - frozen or fresh broccoli florets
  - any other fresh or frozen veggies you want
- water

## Spices

- 2 - 3 good pinches sea salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp basil
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1 - 2 tsp red pepper flakes
- cayenne pepper to taste (it's very hot)
- any other spices you want

## Directions

1. Cook onion, garlic, peppers in olive oil until soft (about 5 minutes, medium heat)
2. Add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, beans, potatoes, carrots, celery - mix together
3. Add additional vegetables
4. Add water until it is about 2 inches from the top of the pan
5. Add spices - mix together well
6. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook on low simmer for 60 minutes or until vegetables are soft, stirring occasionally
7. Uncover, stir and let sit for 10-20 minutes to cool
8. Serve with bread or crackers
