This is simple to make and I always have the ingredients on hand. It is easy to add some cooked chicken breast or vegetables, or both to take it further. Increase the sauce a bit if you add chicken or cooked vegetables. Its more of an art than a science.

## Ingredients

- 4 oz pasta (Fettucine is classic, I prefer Linguine, any pasta will do)
- 3-4 TBSP whipping cream
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
- 1 TBSP Butter
- **Optional** Cracked Black Pepper

## Directions

1. Let cream warm to room temperature
2. Cook and Rinse pasta, return to hot pan
3. Add cream, parmesan and butter to pasta
4. Toss gently until pasta is covered
5. Serve with Cracked Black Pepper
