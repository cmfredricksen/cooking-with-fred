Sometimes I make this sauce to pour over ice cream. It is more of an art than a science, so you can play around with the amounts.

## Ingredients

- heavy whipping cream
- semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Add about 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1/4 cup chocolate chips to a small saucepan
2. Heat over medium temperature
3. Stir often
4. Once it is warm and the chocolate starts to melt, turn down temp to medium low
5. stir continuously until the sauce is well blended
6. Drizzle over ice cream
